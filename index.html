        <h3 class="activities-header">Skate on the World's largest skating rink</h3>
        <p class="activities-paragraph">
          Each winter, the NCC transforms the historic Rideau Canal into the world’s 
          largest skating rink. The Rideau Canal Skateway winds its way through the heart 
          of the National Capital over a total length of 7.8 km. A UNESCO World Heritage Site, 
          the Rideau Canal in winter becomes a treasure that is the pride of the National Capital
          and a signature destination.
          The skating season typically runs from January to early March, 
          but it is weather-dependent. When open, 
          the Skateway is free and accessible 7 days a week, 24 hours a day.

        <p class="activities-paragraph">
          Canada's Parliament Hill isn't just home to the country's government; 
          it's also a cultural and community hub whose activities are hosted in an incredible setting. 
          You can, for example, do yoga on Parliament Hill every Wednesday at noon during the summer.
          You can also take in the Sound and Light show, which for 30 minutes projects a beautiful, engaging story onto the Parliament Buildings themselves.
